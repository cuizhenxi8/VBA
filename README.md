# VBA
This is a simple VBA code which can solve the refresh symbol data function!

Module1 file : get the company every data which is "Prev Close" 	"Open"  	"Day's Range"  	"Volume"
               that is the data i concerned.(we can define more data type according to the need)
               
               
               
Module2 file : get the company list from the wikipedia and put that into the column "A"
               

EXCEL.png file: this is the final results!
        

Note: because the company number is so big ,we just choose part of them!
